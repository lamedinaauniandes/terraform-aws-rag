White-box techniques rely on the assumption that complete information about\\nthe system (e.g., code, data, and architecture) is available. Black-box techniques, on the other\\nhand, operate under the premise that no internal details of the system are accessible, focusing\\ninstead on assessing the system’s performance and correctness based solely on specified require-\\nments. Due to the potentially vast amount of data generated by these systems, data-quality\\ntechniques leverage this information to infer system behavior and detect possible issues.\\nIn (RL), various methods exist for the testing and evaluation of agents.

Statistical analysis confirmed that, for most agents, the generated test\\ncases led to significantly lower success rates or reduced average rewards compared to standard\\nexecution.\\nv',\n",

       " '1\\nChapter 1\\nIntroduction\\nReinforment Learning (RL) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) have seen increasing inter-\\nest and research advances in recent years. The combination of deep learning and RL, referred to\\nas Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), has achieved success to solve various decision-making\\nproblems such as autonomous driving and robotics, while NLP has experienced a notable suc-\\ncess with the introduction of transformer architecture, particularly the decoder-only transformer\\nmodel and other architectures, such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term\\nMemory (LSTMs) with their primary distinction lying in their capacity to handle memory with\\nlong sequences and parallel processing.\\nDRL has recently been applied in many practical contexts. For instance, Netflix uses it to\\nrecommend which movie to show to a user in order to maximize engagement (System of recom-\\nmendation) [3], Microsoft developed Personalizer, a service developer that can be use for content\\nrecomendation [3]. Other applications include the mastery of strategy games such as Dota 2 and\\nStarCraft 2 in which it has defeated human players [2].\\nWith the introduction of the paper \"Attention is All you need\" Vaswani et al. [15] published\\nin 2017 where they introduce the transformer model laying down the foundation for modern\\nNLP and sequence modeling, such techniques have influenced the development of architectures\\nlike BERT, GPT, and other state-of-the-art NLP models, gaining huge popularity in all fields.\\nThe utility and use of NLP-based tools has been a great advantage for society and probably a\\nprincipal engine for progress.\\nFor the constantly growing use of RL models in many fields, there has been a growing need',\n",
       " '1. Introduction\\nof testing such models. Therefore, we have built a novel way for testing RL agents by bridging\\ntwo fields. To reconcile both fields, we need to reconcile the infinite state spaces in the case of\\n(continuous) RL agents, and the finite vocabulary/alphabet used in NLP models.\\nWe put forward a language as a means to reconcile RL and NLP. Through the execution of an\\nagent, this is in continuous interaction with the environment establishing a language the proposed\\napproach build such language is based on the mathematical concept of abstraction, often called\\n’equivalences classes’ or ’abstracts classes’. The vocabulary for testing an RL program consist of\\nabstract classes inputs for NLP models, wich then can produce scenarios (i.e., paths of abstract\\nstates - abstract paths) with possible fails or lower rewards.\\nNLP models model/generate abstracts paths, that is, sequences of state representative ab-\\nstracts classes and the actions. Afterwards we validate that the generated abstract paths indeed\\nare possible and lead to a diminished agent performance. To do this, we developed a test gen-\\nerator cases program extracts regions from abstract paths and disrupt representative states in\\neach class to observe the agent’s behavior.\\nWe evaluate our approach using agents selected from the GitHub OpenAI Gym leaderboard.\\nFor each agent, we first generate logs from both training and execution, which serve as inputs to\\nour implementation,MarTest-Pipeline. Based on the forecasted regions produced by the pipeline,\\nwe then construct concrete test cases to evaluate the agent’s performance.\\nOur results show that the implementation is able to identify regions associated with lower\\naverage rewards and reduced success rates. Moreover, we demonstrate that the performance on\\nthe testing samples is statistically significantly lower than that observed under normal execution,\\nhighlighting that high performance of an agent trained in a normal execution does not guarantee\\nrobustness under targeted testing conditions.\\nThesis Outline\\nThe remainder of this thesis is organized as follows:\\n• Chapter 2 – Background:Introduces the theoretical foundations relevant to this work,\\nincluding reinforcement learning and Markov decision processes (MDPs), natural language\\nprocessing models, and various forms of abstraction used to represent agent-environment\\n2',\n",

Assumptions and design decisions are also discussed.\\n• Chapter 4 – Implementation:Presents the detailed structure of theMarTest-Pipeline,\\nexplaining each module in the pipeline, from the processing of logs and Q-values to the\\ngeneration of abstract episodes, classification models, and the conditioned transformer used\\nto produce test case regions.\\n• Chapter 5 – Experimental Design: Details the experimental setup, including the\\nselected agents from theCartPole and LunarLander environments. It also describes how\\nconcrete test cases are generated from the abstract representations and evaluates the agents\\nusing statistical analysis. The chapter concludes with a discussion on threats to validity.\\n• Chapter 6 – Limitations and Future Work:Discusses the current limitations of the\\napproach and outlines possible future directions, including the refinement of abstraction\\nlevels, integrationoflearning-basedrepresentations, anddeeperunificationofreinforcement\\nlearning and natural language processing techniques.\\n3',\n",

Reinforment Learning, Makov process desicion (MDP)\\nReinforcement Learning trains an agent that interacts with an environmento maximize the ob-\\nserved reward obtained from the environment after action execution, RL uses a trial and error\\nstrategy to explore the environment. At every state, the agent chooses an action to execute from\\nthe set of all possible actions for the state, and receive a corresponding reward for the executed\\naction.\\nA Markov Decision Process (MDP) is defined as a 4-tuple< S,A,T,R > where S is the set\\nof continuous non-enumerable states (|S|≥| N|) ,A is the set of (continuous) actions,T is the\\ntransition function whereT : SXAXS →[0,1] such thatT(s,a,s ′) determines the probability\\nof reaching a states′ by performing an actiona in state s, R : SXA →R a reward function\\nthat determines a reward for a pair of an action and a state. At each time step, the agent uses\\na mapping from state to probabilities of selecting each possible action. This mapping is called\\nthe agent’s policyπ: SXA →[0,1] considered the solution of the MDP.',\n",

[13].\\n2.2. Natural Language Processing\\nNatural Language Processing (NLP)[6] is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) and linguistics\\nfocused on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a\\nway that is both meaningful and useful. The key goals of NLP are understanding language,\\ngenerating language and interacting with humans, the applications of NLP techniques are on\\ntext classification, machine translation, speech recognition, text generation, among others. NLP\\ntechniques has been used in other fields as DNA (or RNA) sequences, the field is often referred to\\nas Computational Biology or Bioinformatics, specically in the subfield of Genomic Data Analysis\\nwhere DNA and RNA sequences can be thought of as \"biological texts\"[9].\\nThere are a considerably amount of models in NLP, we will mention those are in the beginning\\na good start for the purpose of our approach.\\n2.2.1. Early Neural Network-Based Models\\nEarly Neural Network-Based Models refer to the first wave of neural network architectures and\\nmethods applied NLP tasks before the dominance of Transformer-based models. These models\\nprimarily relied on feedforward neural networks, recurrent architectures, and word embeddings,\\noffering improvements over traditional statistical and rule-based methods.\\nRNNs\\nRecurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) belong to a family of neural networks designed for processing\\nsequential data. They can process inputs of variable size, such as images, and can scale to much\\nlonger sequences than networks without sequence-based specialization [5].\\n6',\n",
       " '2.2. Natural Language Processing\\nRNNs process data sequentially, meaning the output at a given step depends not only on the\\ncurrent input but also on information from previous steps, they have a hidden state that serves\\nas a \"memory,\" capturing information from previous time steps.\\nThe architecture for RNNs given a input sequenceX = [x1,x2,...,x T] where T is the sequence\\nlength, we have:\\nht = f(Wtht−1 + Wxxt + b)\\nyt = g(Wyht + c)\\nWhere Wt,Wx,Wy,b,c are parameters of the model andg is the output activation function\\n(e.g, softmax for classification)\\nLSTMs\\nLong Short-Term Memory (LSTMs) are a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) known\\nas gated RNNs. They are based on the idea of introducing self-loops to create paths through\\nwhich the gradient can flow for long durations. LSTMs have been found to be extremely suc-\\ncessful in many applications, such as unconstrained handwriting recognition, speech recognition,\\nhandwriting generation, machine translation, image captioning, and parsing [5].\\nTransformer\\nThe Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017), introduced in the seminal paper \"Attention\\nIs All You Need\" (2017), revolutionized the field of NLP and later impacted other domains like\\ncomputer vision.

Inputs training and execution logs\\nThe pipeline begins with two types of logs: training logs, which record the agent’s behavior\\nduring the training phase, and execution logs, which capture its behavior after training (i.e.,\\nduring real-world deployment). Although it is not strictly necessary to provide both types of\\nlogs, combining them can help balance the dataset. In particular, if the execution logs contain an\\ninsufficient number of failure episodes —as may happen in some cases where the agent performs\\nperfectly with no observed failures— an effective strategy is to augment them with records from\\nthe training phase.\\n4.2.2. Data Balacing\\nIn this stage of the pipeline, we specify a mixture ratiop∈[0,1] and sample from the training\\nlogs accordingly. Since early training episodes may not accurately represent the agent’s behavior,\\nwe drawm episodes from training data wherem = p·Ntrain and are sample according to the\\nprobability distribution over episodes introduced by Zolfagharian [1, Sección IV,Ec. (6)]:\\nP(ei) = i\\nNtrain∑\\nj=1\\nj\\n, i = 1,2,...,m,\\nwhere Ntrain denotes the total number of training episodes. This weighting favors latter (more\\nrepresentative) episodes while still incorporating early-stage data with more state exploration.\\nThe output of this stage is an execution log combining episodes of both training and execution.\\n16',\n",

Furthermore, as we have already obtained the rewards, we do not discount the\\nrewards. As a consequence we calculate the q-values as:γ = 1,\\nqπ(s,a) =\\n∞∑\\nk=0\\nRt+k+1\\nThe end result of this is the q-table with the q-value for each state-action pair.\\n4.3.

This module generates a JSON file containing a\\ndictionary, where the keys are the representatives of the abstract classes and the values are lists\\nof the states grouped within each class.\\nSince the definition ofQ∗-irrelevance abstraction depends on the abstraction level—a config-\\nurable parameter—the user can set this value according to the desired granularity.\\nNote that at this stage, we are constructing the vocabulary referenced in Section 3.1.\\n4.4.

Our model provides a list of such high-risk initial regions, indicating\\nsituations where failure may occur within a limited number of steps.\\nFrom each initial region within an abstract sequence produced by the conditioned Trans-\\nformer (e.g.,w50 in ˆτ = w50 1 w12 0 ...w 223), we sampled 100 states and applied perturbations\\nto each point. Specifically, we added noise sampled from a uniform distribution in the range\\n[−0.001,0.001] to each coordinate. This perturbation step enhances the testing process by intro-\\nducing slight variability into the state space.\\nFor each perturbed state, we initialized the environment and executed the agent starting from\\nthat point. We then compared the resulting rewards with those obtained by executing the agent\\nunder normal conditions.\\nDue to the nature of theLunarLander-v2 environment, an additional consideration is required.\\nIn this environment, the lander always starts at coordinatex= 0.0 and approximatelyy≈1.41\\nin normalized coordinates. In the internalBox2D coordinate system, this corresponds to a fixed\\nstarting point near(10.0, 13.33).\\nTherefore, it is necessary to validate whether a given state can be considered a valid initial\\nstate for the environment. Only those states satisfying this condition are used, and perturbations\\nare applied to them within the uniform random range described earlier. These perturbed states\\nare then used to initialize the environment during testing.\\n5.5.

Threats to Validity\\nThreats to external validityOur experiment aims to validate the use of the test case gener-\\nator for evaluating reinforcement learning agents. We selected a total of six agents from two\\ndifferent environments—CartPole and LunarLander—ranked at different positions in the public\\nleaderboard. This selection strategy was designed to capture a range of agent performances\\nand architectures, thereby reducing the risk of bias and improving the generalizability of our\\nfindings.\\nHowever, we observed that in some cases, the agents’ behavior did not align with expectations\\nbased on their leaderboard rankings. The most notable example was the agent Shakti, which,\\ndespite being ranked highest among the CartPole agents, showed the worst performance during\\nnormal execution, with a success rate of only 14%.\\nSimilarly, although the selected LunarLander agents were distributed across different leader-\\nboard positions, all of them achieved average rewards above 200 in our experiments. In partic-\\nular, the agent Rokenes achieved both the highest average reward and the highest success rate,\\ndespite not being the top-ranked agent in the public leaderboard.\\n41',\n",
       " '5. Experimental Design\\nThese discrepancies suggest that leaderboard rankings may not fully reflect agent robustness un-\\nder different testing conditions, and highlight the importance of evaluating agents using diverse\\nand controlled scenarios.\\nThreats to internal validityOne potential threat to internal validity arises from the specific\\nhandling required for the LunarLander environment. In this case, it was necessary to validate\\nwhether the sampled states could be considered valid initial states, since the environment can\\nonly be initialized from a limited region of the state space.\\nBy default, LunarLander starts from normalized coordinates(x= 0.0, y≈1.41), which corre-\\nspond to approximately(10.0, 13.33) in Box2D coordinates. Any perturbation or state sampled\\noutside of this valid initialization region would not be accepted by the environment as a true\\nstarting state.\\nAs a result, the number of valid samples per region was often reduced, leading to smaller overall\\nsample sizes for these agents. This constraint may have introduced a bias in the testing data or\\naffected the statistical power of the results in the LunarLander experiments.\\n42',\n",

       " '6. Conclusion, Limitations and Future Work\\n6.2. Limitations\\nThis work presents a novel approach to testing reinforcement learning agents using a symbolic\\ngenerator based on transformer models and abstract state-action representations. While the\\nresults are promising and demonstrate the generator’s ability to identify failure-prone regions,\\nseveral limitations must be acknowledged:\\n• Dependence on initial state space constraints:In the LunarLander environment,\\nonly a limited subset of states can be used as valid initial states. This required an explicit\\nvalidation step to ensure sampled states could be used for environment initialization. As\\na consequence, the effective sample size for LunarLander agents was reduced, potentially\\nlimiting the statistical power of the results.\\n• Uneven sample sizes across agents:The test case generator attempts to sample up to\\n100 states per high-risk region. However, some abstract classes contained fewer than 100\\nstates in both CartPole and LunarLander environments, resulting in variation in sample\\nsizes across agents and environments. This may have introduced some imbalance in the\\nstatistical comparisons.\\n• Fixed abstraction level:All experiments were conducted using a fixed abstraction level\\nof d = 4 . While this value provided a reasonable trade-off between expressiveness and\\ngenerality, it is possible that a different abstraction depth might yield better or more\\ninterpretable results depending on the agent and environment.\\n• Limited evaluation scope: The approach was tested only on agents from two envi-\\nronments: CartPole and LunarLander. Although these environments differ in complexity\\nand dynamics, further evaluation on more diverse tasks—particularly continuous control\\nand high-dimensional environments—is needed to assess the general applicability of the\\nmethod.\\n• Transformer conditioning is limited:The transformer model was trained conditioned\\nonly on the average reward and failure probability. While this was sufficient for the current\\nexperiments, future versions could incorporate richer contextual information (e.g., policy\\n44',\n",

Future Work\\nentropy, time horizon, or agent architecture) to improve the diversity and precision of\\ngenerated test cases.\\n• Mismatchwithleaderboardexpectations: Insomecases, theperformanceobservedin\\nnormal execution did not match the agent’s leaderboard ranking. For example, the Shakti\\nagent, which held the top rank among CartPole submissions, showed the lowest success\\nrate in our experiments. This highlights the need to interpret leaderboard positions with\\ncaution and emphasizes the value of independent and reproducible testing frameworks.\\n6.3. Future Work\\nOne potential extension is to design abstraction mechanisms that are adaptive—i.e., where the\\nabstraction depth is learned based on agent behavior or performance metrics. Another important\\ndirection for future work is to implement alternative definitions of abstract classes. This is\\nespecially relevant, as it may provide better insight into the interaction between the agent and the\\nenvironment. Lastly, incorporating richer conditioning signals into the Transformer, or exploring\\narchitectures specifically tailored for causal reasoning in RL environments, may improve the\\nquality of the generated test cases and help uncover more nuanced weaknesses in agent policies.\\nThis work was guided by the intuition thatreward may be a consequence of a shared language\\nbetween the agent and the environment. While this idea is still in an early and exploratory stage,\\nit suggests several possible directions for future research.\\nOne such direction is to investigate the relationship between the level of abstraction used\\nto represent agent-environment interactions and the rewards obtained. It may be possible to\\nformulate an optimization process—either analytical or learned—that selects the abstraction\\nlevel most appropriate for a given task or agent architecture.\\nAnother line of inquiry involves a closer integration between abstract symbolic representations\\nand transformer-based models. Rather than conditioning the transformer on simple reward\\nstatistics, future models could be trained to evaluate or even generate abstract behavior trajec-\\ntories as structured linguistic sequences—potentially assigning meaning and structure to patterns\\nof interaction.\\n45',\n",
       " '6. Conclusion, Limitations and Future Work\\nAlthough preliminary, these ideas point to a broader aspiration: to better understand the role\\nof representation, communication, and interpretation in reinforcement learning. By approaching\\nthe agent-environment loop as a form of emergent communication, we hope to take small steps\\ntoward a more unified view of learning, abstraction, and meaning.\\n46',\n",
